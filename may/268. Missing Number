Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int  n= nums.size();
        int low =0;
        int end = n-1;
        while(low<=end){
            int mid = (low +end)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==mid){
                low = mid+1;
            }
            else{
              end = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
};
