Input
The only line contains two integers l and r (1≤l<r≤1018, r−l+1≤3⋅105, (r−1) is odd).

Output
If any solution exists, print "YES" in the first line. Each of the next (r−1+l)/2 lines should contain some pair of integers. 
GCD of numbers in each pair should be equal to 1. All (r−l+1) numbers should be pairwise distinct and should have values from 
l to r inclusive.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

If there exists no solution, print "NO".

**********better approach *******

gcd of two consecutive is 1 ............

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;




ll ls, r;
int  main(){
    cin>>ls>>r;

    cout<<"YES"<<endl;

    while(ls<r){
        cout<<ls<<" "<<ls+1<<endl;
        ls+=2;
    }
}
